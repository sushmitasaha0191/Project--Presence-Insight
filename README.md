# Project--Presence-Insight
I have created the visual representation for presence insights of the employees within the organisation. Here, I built the visualization where I have calculated the monthly and weekly Presence, Work from home and Sick leave percentage of the employees for the better functioning of the organization.
# Objective 
To understand the working preferences of the employees between work from home and work from office.
To understand on which months maximum employees are present in the company. So, that companies can accordingly plan their team building activities and team lunch in which majority of people can participate.
To monitor the weekly and monthly percentage of WFH or Sick leave for the employees. 
If the companies have good insights about when the employees are taking maximum no. of sick leaves then they can also run employee wellness plan accordingly to boost their employeesâ€™ health and wellness
